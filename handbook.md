# Purpose

This document aims to introduce volunteers to the Electromagnetic Field
(EMF) organisation. It aims to describe the organisational structure and
its ways of communication and working.

The document is for the consumption of those volunteering in the
organisation of the event.

# What is EMF and What Are We Aiming To Do

Electromagnetic Field is a non-profit UK camping festival for those with
an inquisitive mind or an interest in making things: hackers, artists,
geeks, crafters, scientists, and engineers.

To help matters along, we provide fast internet, power to the tent, good
beer, and amazing installations, entirely organised by a dedicated team
of volunteers. It is this team of volunteers that this document is aimed
it. If you feel this isn't what you want Electromagnetic Field to be
then perhaps volunteering to organise it is not such a good idea.

# Organisational Structure

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}

\end{wrapfigure}

The Directors of Electromagnetic Field Ltd are Jonty Wareing and Russ
Garrett. They are legally (and in some cases financially) liable for
whatever may happen with EMF. Ultimately they take
responsibility for each event and the organising of them. They hold a
final veto over any major decision affecting the organisation or event.

The top level in the organisation is the admin group which consists of
the Team Leads, their deputies, and ‘certain selected others’ the
directors feel are of value to this group. Each person in this group has
one or more responsibility, which are outlined below.

Each team contains one or more volunteers and have an area of
responsibility to carry out.

Finally, there are the participants, those who come to the event without
aiding in the organisation of it. A percentage of them will volunteer
during the event to ensure the event runs smoothly, or provide
activities via villages. In order to carry out these duties they may
well need access to information or training from teams.

## How We Operate

EMF operates in a mostly informal manner. It’s split into teams which
have responsibilities to carry out. Each volunteer in a team reports to
a Lead and their Deputy, and they in turn report to the admin group.

Beyond that, there is little rigidity or formal communication; be
prepared for overlap between teams; some Leads will have more say in the
running of things simply because their area of responsibility commands
it. A good example of this are responsibilities for Site Infrastructure;
it's very likely whatever you do will involve the persons responsible
for this, which will impact their work and what they can deliver, which
in turn impacts the whole event.

### Before the Event

Information is rarely guarded, and you should feel free to ask questions
of others as long as it’s not impacting their ability to complete their
tasks. Some information is kept confidential within the admin team -
mostly facts such as ticket sales and operational details. This is done
to prevent external parties from making judgments about the potential
success of the event without knowing the full context.

You will inevitably learn new skills during the course of your
volunteering and this is a Good Thing™. It is not only useful to you,
but useful to us since you may well volunteer at the next event,
carrying over experience from the previous one.

There is a high propensity within this group for ‘bikeshedding’[^1], so
please be mindful when making suggestions outside your area of
expertise.

Do not be afraid to ask for help. It's ok to doubt yourself, it's ok to
admit you don't think you’re capable of completing a task or looking
after a responsibility. As of writing, the experience of the last three
events shows that people are more than willing to take time out and aid,
assist and help in whatever way is possible.

The size of the organisation fluctuates massively over time and will be
at its largest during an event. Some teams operate continuously, whilst
others only awake from slumber mere months before the event. Some only
operate at specific times during an event.

### During the Event

EMF will operate along the lines that have been set out above and along
the channels of responsibility laid out below. However, things can go
wrong, suppliers can leave us in the lurch etc so there is a tendency to
operating towards a ‘structured chaos’. It appears messy, but things
tend to work out and those in the admin group are very much on top of
problems. By this point you should be familiar with who you are
accountable to and be able to trust those in charge.

# Communications and Tools

EMF has multiple communication channels, though IRC and email are the
most common. However, physical meetings do have their place and are
organised regularly in the run up to an event. Attendance is highly
encouraged for those that can make them.

## Admin
\begin{tabular}{l |  l | l}
Type     &       Details              &        Comments       \\ \hline
IRC      & \#emfcamp-admin on FreeNode & Strictly Invite Only \\
Mailing List & https://lists.emfcamp.org/listinfo/admin & Subscription
is mandatory \\
Redmine & access given upon request & Project Management tool used by
some but not all \\
Google Drive & access given upon request & Our central document store
\end{tabular}

All admin communication (including through the above means) is to be
considered confidential unless otherwise agreed.

## Teams

Each team often has its own methods and quirks for communication, so
check with the Lead to understand how best to communicate. Some may have
their own IRC channels and mailing list, whilst others make do with
attempts at telepathy. Its best to check with your Lead.

# Conduct and Behaviour

By becoming a volunteer you agree to adhere to the [Code of
Conduct](https://www.emfcamp.org/code-of-conduct)
as extended and applied to the orga, before and after any event takes
place.

Violation of the CoC can be reported here (xxxxxx) and will be dealt
with by at least one director and others delegated with the
responsibility. Violation of the CoC may result in you being asked to
leave the organising group, and possibly being banned from attending an
event.

If you are in charge of volunteers, remember:
-   they are not your work slaves. they’ve given up their time to help.
    be nice
-   be explicit and clear with what you want them to do and what you
    expect from them
-   give them room and authority to complete their task. a little bit of
    agency can bring a feeling of ownership and pride in work done, not
    to mention some enjoyment.

## Self Care

Burnout is a common theme in large volunteer-organised events such as
this. This usually happens because there is a lack of volunteers to help
organise before the event, or a shortage of volunteers during events. A
self imposed pressure to ensure the success of an event at all costs no
doubt adds to this.

**If you’re experiencing a high workload, you are expected and
encouraged to regularly communicate this upwards in the organisation**.
This is especially important if you’re a Team Lead - there are others in
the admin team who will either have the time to help you, or the ability
to find others who can. Between us, we’ve had extensive experience
running (and getting burned out at) these kind of events. It’s a lot
easier for us to help if we catch problems early.

Ultimately, we run these events because we enjoy doing it. If you’re not
enjoying your role, we want to fix it so you can.

## On the Event Site

During an event is when stresses tend to run the highest. The
instructions on self care apply doubly so during this time.

Being aggressive with either volunteers or participants is completely
unacceptable. Getting anxious or edgy is a good sign you’re becoming
stressed, or doing too much and that it’s time to take a break.

What does a break involve?
-   at least a 4 hour break from doing any work
-   give your radio/comms to a lead or deputy.

# Team Leads

## How to Become One

Due to our informal nature, and the varying nature of each event, we
don’t have a set of formal parameters you need to meet to become a team
lead, so selection can be very subjective. Informally it can be best
summarised by the following:
-   someone the admin group can trust and gets on well with
-   previous festival or volunteer-orga experience
-   experience of the responsibilities of that team

## Responsibilities

-   You are responsible for managing your own budget and reporting this
    to the Treasurer.
-   You must coordinate with other teams about infrastructure
    requirements, deliveries and any time critical events in your plan
-   Keep the build/site schedules populated and upto date.
-   Document your area of responsibility on the wiki
    -   if you’re responsibilities change, or are added to, write
        them down. they will be used to update this handbook
    -   this helps us when recruiting new people to the orga
    -   make sure to put your and your deputies name down so people know
        who to contact

## Deputies

Each team needs a lead and a deputy. It can help reduce the workload and
removes the single-point-of-failure scenario. Pick someone you can work
with and you think has competency in the task at hand. A director may
pick someone on your behalf.

## Resources

You will likely have a budget which has been agreed upon by the
Treasurer. These budgets are frozen early so make sure you have a good
idea of what's required and accurate quotes from suppliers for them.

You are able to request online infrastructure such as IRC channels,
mailing lists, or space in the redmine instance.

Again, remember you need not suffer alone if you are struggling. Speak
to the admin group, we’re happy to help.

# Organisational Volunteers

## How to Become One

Again, due to out informal nature we can't give a set of formal
parameters. Informally it can be covered by the following

-   having non disruptive behaviour
-   preferably some event experience, or experience in the area you wish
    to volunteer for
-   recommendations by other admin group members

Look at the list of Roles and Responsibilities and talk to the Leads
responsible for that area. You should be given clear instructions for
the task at hand and authority to complete it.

# Roles and Responsibilities

Below is a condensed list of the roles and responsibilities we think we
need for an event. A full list can be found in the ‘Roles and
Responsibilities’ document.

They have been grouped into categories, though this is not necessarily
representative of how teams will be structured. Each event is different;
different locations, improvements in infrastructure, providing more
services for participants to use etc. Thus the teams might end up being
structured differently for each event. People will want to rotate roles,
or even sit out an event altogether. We also strive to improve and do
more each time, not to mention learning from our past mistakes.
